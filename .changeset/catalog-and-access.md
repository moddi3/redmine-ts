Add `access` to `createRedmine`. `"read-only"` sends only `GET` requests and `"no-delete"` refuses `DELETE`. Any other request fails with the new error kind `access_denied` before anything is sent, for every method, listing, `issues.transition`, `attachments.upload` and `rm.request`. The default, `"full"`, changes nothing.

Add the `@redmine-ts/sdk/catalog` entrypoint for tool layers such as MCP servers. `catalog` has one entry per client method with its id, namespace and verb, title, description, docs link, HTTP method, safety class, versions, stability, a JSON Schema (draft 2020-12) of its input, and a JSON Schema of the item it returns. It is a separate entrypoint, so the main bundle does not grow.
